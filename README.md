# Is Reuse All You Need? A Systematic Comparison of Regular Expression Composition Strategies

This repository contains the artifact for the paper "Is Reuse All You Need? A Systematic Comparison of Regular Expression Composition Strategies." The paper investigates whether regex composition tasks are unique enough to merit dedicated machinery or if reuse is sufficient.

## Overview

Regular expressions (regexes) are prevalent in software engineering but are known to be difficult to compose correctly. This research systematically evaluates three major regex composition strategies:

1. **Reuse-by-example**: Our novel operationalization of regex reuse practices
2. **Formal regex synthesis**: Using algorithmic approaches to generate regexes
3. **Generative AI**: Using large language models (LLMs) to compose regexes

We evaluated these strategies across multiple dimensions including accuracy, syntactic and semantic similarity, constraint balance, and computational efficiency.
