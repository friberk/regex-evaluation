You are an expert in Python regular expressions (regexes). Generate three regexes in Python that match the following list of strings (shown in quotes): {positive_strings}. The regexes should exclude strings with a pattern similar to the examples: {negative_strings}. 

The three regexes should be:

1. **Conservative**: A strict regex that matches only the given positive strings as closely as possible while ensuring the negative strings are excluded.
2. **Liberal**: A more generalized regex that matches not only the given examples but also other similar patterns that fit the overall intended pattern of the positive strings. This regex should exclude the negative strings but work in more general cases.
3. **Balanced**: A regex that finds a balance between the conservative and liberal approaches. It should match the given examples well and allow for limited flexibility to match similar patterns, but still exclude the negative examples. The aim is to ensure reasonable generalization while avoiding overfitting to the examples.

Follow the examples below to understand the format and requirements:

### Example 1:
Positive strings: ["apple", "application", "applesauce"]  
Negative strings: ["app", "append", "approach"]  
Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for matching strings related to 'apple'. The conservative regex matches only the exact examples. The liberal regex matches any word starting with 'appl', allowing broader matches. The balanced regex allows slight generalization but restricts unwanted variations.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "^appl(?:e|ication|esauce)?$",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly matches 'apple', 'application', and 'applesauce' only, ensuring no other words match."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "^appl\\w*$",
      "explanation": "This regex matches any string starting with 'appl', allowing for a broader set of matches like 'applepie', 'appletree', etc."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "^appl(?:e\\w*|ication)$",
      "explanation": "This regex allows slight generalization, supporting 'apple', 'application', 'applesauce', and similar variations, like 'applepie' or 'appletree', while avoiding unrelated terms."
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2:
Positive strings: ["1432", "5672", "9012"]
Negative strings: ["123", "56789", "01234"]
Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for matching exactly four-digit numbers. The conservative regex only matches the provided examples. The liberal regex matches any four-digit number. The balanced regex ensures generalization while avoiding five-digit matches.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "^(1432|5672|9012)$",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly matches only the three provided numbers: 1234, 5678, and 9012."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "^\\d{4}$",
      "explanation": "This regex matches any four-digit number, allowing broader matches like 1111, 9999, etc."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "^\\d{3}[2]$",
      "explanation": "This regex matches any four-digit numbers ending with '2', including the provided examples and other valid numbers like '4322', '2392', etc."
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3:
Positive strings: ["cat", "cater", "category"]
Negative strings: ["car", "cats", "cart"]
Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for matching strings related to 'cat'. The conservative regex matches only the given examples. The liberal regex matches any string starting with 'cat'. The balanced regex allows for reasonable variations without matching unrelated strings like 'car'.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "^cat(?:er|egory)?$",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly matches only 'cat', 'cater', and 'category'."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "^(cat(?!s))\\w*$",
      "explanation": "This regex matches any string starting with 'cat', such as 'catalyst', 'catnip', etc., while excluding 'cats'."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "^cat(?:e\\S*)?$",
      "explanation": "This regex matches the literal 'cat' and, if followed by additional characters, requires that they begin with an 'e', thereby capturing variants like 'caterpillar' while excluding undesired matches like 'car'."
    }
  }
}
```

Now, given the following input:

Positive strings: {positive_strings}  
Negative strings: {negative_strings}  

Provide your response strictly in JSON format as shown below, and never have text outside the brackets. The "explanation" fields should include a detailed breakdown of the problem, the necessary components of the corresponding regex, the reasoning behind its construction, and further clarifications. The "regex" fields must include the final regex as a single-line Python string, with no newlines or extraneous text. Ensure proper escaping of special characters only when they are intended as literals (i.e., not as regex metacharacters).

```json
{
  "explanation": "String",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "String",
      "explanation": "String"
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "String",
      "explanation": "String"
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "String",
      "explanation": "String"
    }
  }
}
```
