You are an expert in Python regular expressions (regexes). Generate three regexes in Python that should extract the following substrings using capturing groups. The regexes must extract the specified substrings without matching or extracting anything else, particularly those provided in the negative examples. Each substring is provided with its original string for context (shown in quotes): {first_matched_substring_1} in {test_string_1}, ...
Here is a list of some examples of strings which should have no substring matches (shown in quotes): {negative_strings}.

The three regexes should be:

1. **Conservative**: A strict regex that captures only the given substrings as closely as possible within their original context. It ensures no false positives by being highly specific and does not generalize beyond the given examples.
2. **Liberal**: A more generalized regex that captures not only the exact substrings but also other similar patterns that fit the overall intended pattern of the substrings. This regex should exclude the negative examples but work in more general cases.
3. **Balanced**: A regex that finds a balance between the conservative and liberal approaches. It captures the provided substrings well and allows for limited flexibility to capture similar patterns, but still excludes the negative examples. The aim is to ensure reasonable generalization while avoiding overfitting to the examples.

Follow the examples below to understand the format and requirements:

### Example 1:
Substrings to match:  
- "apple" in "I like apple pie."  
- "application" in "The application works well."  
- "applesauce" in "We made applesauce today."

Negative strings: ["app", "append", "approach"]

Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for capturing substrings related to 'apple'. The conservative regex targets the exact substrings in their context using capturing groups. The liberal regex captures words starting with 'appl' using a capturing group. The balanced regex allows slight variations while excluding unwanted matches.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "\\b(appl(?:e|ication|esauce)?)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly captures 'apple', 'application', and 'applesauce' as whole words using a capturing group, ensuring no unrelated substrings like 'append' are matched."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "\\b(appl\\w*)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures any word starting with 'appl' using a capturing group, allowing for a broader set of matches like 'applepie', 'appletree', etc."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "\\b(appl(?:e\\w*|ication))\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures 'apple', 'application', and 'applesauce' while allowing for similar variations like 'applepie' or 'appletree', but excluding unrelated terms like 'append' or 'approach'."
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2:
Substrings to match:  
- "1432" in "Order number: 1432."  
- "5672" in "Your code: 5672."  
- "9012" in "Reference: 9012."

Negative strings: ["123", "56789", "01234"]

Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for capturing four-digit substrings. The conservative regex captures only the provided substrings. The liberal regex captures any four-digit numbers. The balanced regex generalizes slightly but avoids larger or shorter numbers.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "\\b(1432|5672|9012)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly captures the provided four-digit substrings: '1234', '5678', and '9012', using a capturing group."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "\\b(\\d{4})\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures any standalone four-digit number, such as '1111' or '9999', using a capturing group."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "\\b\\d{3}[2]\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures the provided substrings and generalizes slightly to include other four-digit numbers ending with '2', like '4322' or '2392', while avoiding mismatches like '123' or '56789'."
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3:
Substrings to match:  
- "cat" in "I own a cat."  
- "cater" in "They cater the event."  
- "category" in "Choose the right category."

Negative strings: ["car", "cats", "cart"]

Response:
```json
{
  "explanation": "Three regex solutions for capturing substrings related to 'cat'. The conservative regex captures the exact substrings using capturing groups. The liberal regex captures any words starting with 'cat' using a capturing group. The balanced regex allows slight flexibility for variations like 'cater' and 'category' while excluding unrelated substrings.",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "\\b(cat(?:er|egory)?)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex strictly captures 'cat', 'cater', and 'category' as standalone substrings using a capturing group."
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "\\b(cat(?!s)\\w*)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures any word starting with 'cat', such as 'catnip', or 'catalog', using a capturing group, but excludes 'cats' from the match."
    },
    "balanced": {
      "regex": "\\b(cat(?:e\\S*)?)\\b",
      "explanation": "This regex captures 'cat', and if followed by 'e', it captures the rest of the word, allowing for 'cater' and 'category', but not 'cats' or 'cart'."
    }
  }
}
```

Now, given the following input:

Substrings to match:  
{first_matched_substring_1} in {test_string_1}, ...

Negative strings: {negative_strings}

Provide your response strictly in JSON format as shown below, and never have text outside the brackets. The "explanation" fields should include a detailed breakdown of the problem, the necessary components of the corresponding regex, the reasoning behind its construction, and further clarifications. The "regex" fields must include the final regex as a single-line Python string, with no newlines or extraneous text. Ensure proper escaping of special characters only when they are intended as literals (i.e., not as regex metacharacters).

  "explanation": "String",
  "solutions": {
    "conservative": {
      "regex": "String",
      "explanation": "String"
    },
    "liberal": {
      "regex": "String",
      "explanation": "String"
    },
    "balanced": {
